### Why I write the blog

H﻿ello, This is Sitao Tong, I'm writing this post to briefly summarize how I learn computer science in the past 5 year during my college life.

### TL;DR:

I﻿ have summarize the nine major course I have learn as an undergraduate, along with the textbook and course project I have done.
* C/C++ programming
* Java programming
* Python programming
* Data Structure
* Algorithm
* Computer Architecture
* Web Development
* OS
* Computer Network
* Database
* Compiler
* Distributed System
* Math


## C/C++ programming

C is my introductory Language, I first learn the language with [TCPL](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) in SU18 at home, and finish the sample exercise like: 

* Anti-polish Expression(scanner/stack)
* calendar(pointer/2-dimension array)

I learn C++ at SU19 following the [open course on Coursera by Peking University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji)

And I learn these course in ZJUT AU18/AU19 and use C++ build a singer contest system([git](https://github.com/OwlinLight/singer-contest-system)) with self-made linked list as the final project.

## Java programming

I learn java in AU19 at ZJUT and read the [head first java](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208). The final project is the local search Engine with Lucene: DocFetcher([git](https://github.com/OwlinLight/DocFetcher)).

I learn Java again in AU20 at OSU in CSE [2221](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2221/web-sw1/schedule.html)/[2231](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2231/web-sw2/schedule.html), final projects include a [calculator](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2221/web-sw1/assignments/projects/natural-number-calculator/natural-number-calculator.html) designed with MVC and a [BugsWorld](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2231/web-sw2/extras/slides/20.BugsWorld-Intro.pdf) compiler.

## Python programming

I follow [CS61A](https://cs61a.org/) Ch1-10 exercise/lab in SU20.

## Data Structure

Firstly learn in AU19 at home following [DSA mooc by ZJU](https://www.icourse163.org/course/zju-93001)

## Algorithm

SP20 in ZJUT

## Computer Architecture

In SU19, I follow the [CSAPP](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) and [course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/schedule.html) and finished first 8 chapter, along with the first 3 labs.

## Web Development

In Sp20, learn HTML/CSS/Java native web development

In Sp21, learn JavaEE and Hibernate, build projects with SSH/SSM

In Au22, build [CSE 3901](https://www.bulabu.dev/meetings) project with Ruby

## OS

First learn it in ZJUT AU20, build Pintos as the final project.

learning OS in CSE 2431 at OSU.

## Computer Network

First learn in ZJUT SP20, with textbook [计算机网络](https://book.douban.com/subject/35498120/)

## Database

Learn SQL(sql server) in ZJUT SP20; Learn non-relational database(mongoDB/node4j) in SP21

## Compiler

Learn in ZJUT AU20, ended with grade 96/100.

CSE 3341 in OSU

## Distributed System

Learn in ZJUT SP21, learn Hadoop following lab in Big data Tech-[大数据技术](https://dblab.xmu.edu.cn/post/bigdata3/)

## Math

Calculus 1-2-3 - ZJUT 18-19 textbook by TongJi University

Linear Algebra - ZJUT 19SP textbook by TongJi University

Intro to Statistic and probability - STAT3470

Discrete Mathematic- read the [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications Seventh Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Its-Applications-Seventh/dp/0073383090)
