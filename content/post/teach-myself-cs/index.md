#﻿# Why I write the blog

H﻿ello, This is Sitao Tong, I'm writing this post to briefly summarize how I learn computer science in the past 5 year during my college life.

##﻿ TL;DR:

I﻿ have summarize the nine major course I have learn as an undergraduate, along with the textbook and course project I have done.

## C/C++ programming

C is my introductory Language, I first learn the language with [TCPL](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) in SU18 at home, and finish the sample exercise like: 

* Anti-polish Expression(scanner/stack)
* calendar(pointer/2-dimension array)

I learn C++ at SU19 following the [open course on Coursera by Peking University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji)

And I learn these course in ZJUT and use C++ build a singer management system with self-made linked list as the final project.

## Java programming

I learn java in AU19 at ZJUT and read the [head first java](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208). The final project is the local search Engine with Lucene: [DocFetcher](https://github.com/OwlinLight/DocFetcher).

I learn Java again in AU20 at OSU in CSE [2221](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2221/web-sw1/schedule.html)/[2231](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2231/web-sw2/schedule.html), final projects include the
