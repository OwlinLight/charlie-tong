The "Document Retriever" is currently a search engine that most people use in their daily lives, such as Google and Baidu, which can support the use of crawled web page content to obtain results in just a few hundred milliseconds. However, we have not experienced this before the advent of search engines. At that time, we even had to traverse the options of portal websites one by one to enter the web pages we wanted to enter. This may be unbearable for us today. However, unfortunately, most people still use this inefficient search method under the Windows system, and the reason is simple - the search engine of the Windows file resource manager is too inefficient. Therefore, we applied the "reverse search" method of Internet search engines to PC local searches. This search rate not only greatly improves efficiency, but also can search for the full text content except for the title. This search engine has extremely important significance for literature management and help document retrieval.
