Our project has basically all the basic functions, including student registration and participation, check-in and check-out, event organizers applying for and organizing events, reviewers approving events, and security checking event qualifications. Combined with our unique geolocation-based recommendation system, students are less likely to miss out on the credits they could have earned due to lack of information.



In addition, the system is deeply integrated into all aspects of student campus life, breaking the rigid and disorderly characteristics of traditional event application systems and second classroom credit software. It can intelligently recommend activities based on the user's registration habits. At the same time, based on the user's geographical location, it can recommend activities in real-time that are nearby, reducing possible time waste and improving the efficiency of attending activities. In addition, administrators can see the real-time heat map of the activities and the time statistics within a period of time. They can generate relevant analysis and make specific and actionable adjustment suggestions.
